# Application Functionality & Flow

Start quiz
Timer starts and counts to 10 seconds, then it will move to the next question.
If the question is answered correctly, the circle in the top left corner will fill in green. 
If the question is answered incorrectly, the circle will turn red. 
The circles stay colored in and remember the previous answer.
At the end of the quiz, a teal overlay will popup with the overall score in a percentage format.
The form in the bottom left corner is to save your initials and will be saved in the browser local storage.
